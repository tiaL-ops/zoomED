[00:00 - 05:00] Intro & The HookTeacher: "Alright, class, cameras on. Let’s look at the chat. If I hold this bowling ball at shoulder height and just stand here for an hour, am I doing 'work' in the physics sense? Type 'Yes' or 'No' in the chat. Landy, I see you said No... why? Correct, because there’s no displacement. In Physics, work is $W = Fd \cos \theta$."[05:00 - 15:00] The Deep Dive: Dot Products & AnglesTeacher: "Now, let's get tricky. If I’m pulling a crate with a rope at a $30^\circ$ angle, only the horizontal component counts. Imagine the vector. We use the cosine because we want the force in the direction of the movement. If I pull straight up and the box moves sideways, work is zero. Why? $\cos 90^\circ$ is zero. Everyone, give me a 'thumbs up' emoji if that $90$-degree logic makes sense."[15:00 - 25:00] Kinetic Energy & The Work-Energy TheoremTeacher: "Work isn't just a number; it changes things. It changes Kinetic Energy ($KE$). Remember $KE = \frac{1}{2}mv^2$. If I do positive work on a car, it speeds up. The Total Work is equal to the change in Kinetic Energy. This is the Work-Energy Theorem. This is vital for the AP exam. If the velocity doubles, the energy quadruples because of that $v$-squared. Look at the poll I just launched."[25:00 - 35:00] Practice Problem & Wrap UpTeacher: "Let's solve: A $2\text{ kg}$ block is pushed with $10\text{ N}$ for $5\text{ meters}$. What’s the final velocity if it started from rest? Use $W = \Delta KE$. I'm seeing some confusion in the chat. 'Where did the $1/2$ go?' Okay, let's slow down. $W = 10\text{ N} \cdot 5\text{ m} = 50\text{ Joules}$. So $50 = \frac{1}{2}(2)v^2$. Solve for $v$."
