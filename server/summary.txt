## Class Transcript

**[00:00 - 12:00] Defining Work and Displacement**

**Professor:** "Good morning. Today we are bridging the gap between forces and energy. Let's start with a simple check. Maya, if I hold a  barbell stationary above my head, am I doing work in the physics sense?"

**Maya (High Engagement):** "No, Professor. Even though you're exerting force, the displacement is zero. Since , if , the total work is zero."

**Professor:** "Perfect. Now, Carlos, look at the screen. I'm showing a diagram of a crate being pulled by a rope at a  angle. If the crate moves horizontally, which part of my force actually does the work?"

**Carlos (Medium Engagement):** "Uh, let me see... is it the whole force? No, wait. Just the part going sideways? The -component?"

**Professor:** "Right. We use the cosine of the angle because we only care about the force parallel to the motion. Liam, you there? What is ?"

**Liam (Low Engagement):** [No response]

**Professor:** "Liam? Check the chat. Okay, we’ll move on."

**[12:00 - 25:00] Kinetic Energy and the Squared Velocity**

**Professor:** "Now let’s talk about Kinetic Energy. The formula is:



Maya, what happens to the energy of a car if the driver doubles the speed from  to ?"

**Maya (High Engagement):** "It quadruples. Because velocity is squared, . So the car has four times the kinetic energy."

**Professor:** "Exactly. This leads us to the Work-Energy Theorem. The net work done on an object equals its change in kinetic energy:



Carlos, if I do positive work on an object, does it speed up or slow down?"

**Carlos (Medium Engagement):** "It should speed up because you're adding energy to it."

**[25:00 - 35:00] Problem Solving and Wrap Up**

**Professor:** "Let's try a calculation. A  mass is at rest. I apply a force that does  of work. What is the final velocity? Liam, can you give us the setup for that?"

**Liam (Low Engagement):** [Direct message sent to Professor: 'Sorry, my mic isn't working. I don't know the formula.']

**Professor:** "Okay, Liam. The formula is . Since  is  and  is , we get . So . We'll stop there for today."

## Lecture Summary

* **Work Calculation:** Work is only performed when a force causes displacement. The formula is .
* **Kinetic Energy:** The energy of an object in motion. It is proportional to the mass and the square of the velocity ().
* **Work-Energy Theorem:** Net work is the mechanism by which kinetic energy changes ().
* **Units:** All energy and work values are measured in Joules (), where .

## Student Engagement Breakdown

* **Student A (Maya):** High Engagement. Actively participated in derivation and understood the  relationship.
* **Student B (Carlos):** Medium Engagement. Present and following, though required slight prompting to recall specific vector components.
* **Student C (Liam):** Low Engagement. Camera remained off, did not participate in chat or audio until prompted directly, and expressed confusion regarding fundamental formulas.
